all the images under Tiles/ are generated using a script

put all images under the appropriate subfolder
(Tiles/Platforms/ doesn't need to be automated so not strict)

if it's an ice/fire image make sure a corresponding fire/ice png is also in that folder
also all ice/fire images should match ice*.png or fire*.png, where the * is matching for the matching textures :)

ALSO: do not delete the pngs in this folder before regenerating them, since they help maintain the order of the sprites. if you do, the order will reset. however this is also the only way to get rid of outdated/deleted sprites.
